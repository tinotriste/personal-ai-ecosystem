LEARNINGS LOG - Continuous Insight Capture
================================================================================

PURPOSE:
- Capture insights, successful patterns, and discoveries from your interactions
- Build a searchable knowledge base of what works for you
- Track cross-domain applications of learnings
- Preserve valuable insights that might otherwise be forgotten

FORMAT:
- Each entry has: Date, Context, Key Insights, Impact
- Organised by category headers for easy scanning
- Archived when older than 14 days to history files

CATEGORY HEADERS (use what fits):
- Pattern Identified: Recurring behaviour patterns you've noticed
- Root Cause: Deep understanding of why something happens
- Cross-Domain Application: Insights that apply across multiple areas
- Key Discovery: Significant realisations or breakthroughs
- Workflow Optimisation: Process improvements that work
- Decision Framework: Mental models for better choices

HOW YOUR AI USES THIS:
- References past learnings when similar situations arise
- Suggests patterns you've identified before
- Builds on previous insights rather than starting fresh

# Learnings Log

**Purpose**: Continuous capture of insights, successful patterns, and cross-domain discoveries.

**Last Updated**: {{DATE}}

**Archive**: Older learnings (14+ days) moved to `history/learnings-log/YYYY-MM.md`

## Pattern Identified: Planning vs Execution Gap (Example Entry)

**Date**: {{DATE}}
**Context**: Noticed a recurring pattern during weekly review. Multiple weeks of detailed planning with limited execution.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Planning feels productive but isn't always**: Creating detailed plans activates reward centres without requiring the discomfort of execution
2. **Execution requires different energy**: Planning is Ni/Ti (thinking, structuring), execution is Se (doing, real-world action)
3. **Accountability gap**: No mechanism to ensure plans become actions

**Impact**:
- Created daily check-in ritual (5 min morning, 5 min evening)
- Reduced weekly task list from 20 items to 10 (realistic execution)
- Added "ship something" as daily non-negotiable

**Cross-Domain Application**:
- Work: Applies to project planning (scope creep from over-planning)
- Personal: Applies to home improvement (endless research, no action)
- Health: Applies to fitness (perfect programme design, inconsistent execution)

## Root Cause: Perfectionism as Protection (Example Entry)

**Date**: {{DATE}}
**Context**: Realised why shipping feels harder than building. Fear of judgment once work is public.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Perfectionism masks fear**: "It's not ready" often means "I'm not ready to be judged"
2. **Building is safe, shipping is vulnerable**: In private, work can't be criticised
3. **Done beats perfect**: A shipped 80% solution beats an unshipped 100% solution every time

**Impact**:
- Adopted "ship then iterate" mindset
- Set time-boxing constraints (2 hours max, then ship whatever exists)
- Reframed feedback as data, not judgment

## Workflow Optimisation: Context Loading Efficiency (Example Entry)

**Date**: {{DATE}}
**Context**: AI was loading full context files every conversation, causing slow starts and token waste.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Progressive disclosure works**: Load only what's needed for the current task
2. **CLAUDE.md files are briefings, not encyclopedias**: Keep them focused and scannable
3. **Skills handle depth**: Detailed workflows live in skills, not context files

**Impact**:
- Reduced context file sizes by 60%
- Created domain-specific CLAUDE.md files (one per project area)
- AI conversations start faster with better focus

---

## Decision Framework: The "Would I Regret This?" Test (Example Entry)

**Date**: {{DATE}}
**Context**: Struggling with a major decision about taking on a new project while already busy.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Regret minimisation works**: Ask "In 6 months, would I regret saying yes or no?"
2. **Opportunity cost is real**: Every yes to something new is a no to something existing
3. **Sequential execution beats parallel complexity**: Finish before starting

**Impact**:
- Used this framework to decline the new project
- Focus on current priorities improved
- Less context-switching, more deep work

---

## Key Discovery: Energy Management Over Time Management (Example Entry)

**Date**: {{DATE}}
**Context**: Despite having enough hours in the day, certain tasks never got done.

**Key Insights**:
1. **Not all hours are equal**: Creative work needs high-energy hours, admin can use low-energy hours
2. **Deep work needs protection**: 2-4 hour blocks, no interruptions, specific times
3. **Rest is productive**: Recovery enables performance, not laziness

**Impact**:
- Mapped energy levels throughout the day
- Scheduled important work during peak energy (morning)
- Protected deep work blocks in calendar
