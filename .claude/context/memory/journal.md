## Example Entry: Week of 15 November 2025

**Rating**: 6/10

**Honest Assessment**:

Week was a mixed bag. Got a lot organised and regained momentum in areas that were stagnating. But execution gaps exposed - planning isn't the same as shipping.

**What Worked**:
- Organisation and planning: Got systems in place for the new project
- Momentum recovery: Areas that were stuck are moving again
- Deep work protected: Wednesday 3.5h block delivered despite morning distractions

**What Didn't Work**:
- Key deliverables not shipping: The important tasks keep getting pushed
- Time estimation failure: Friday's task took all day instead of 2 hours
- Fitness skipped: Gym sessions 0/4 this week

**Core Problem Identified**: **Planning without execution**
- No accountability mechanism for the important work
- Using planning as a way to feel productive without actually shipping

**Priorities Next Week**:
1. Ship the landing page (not plan it, ship it)
2. Establish daily check-in rhythm (5 min morning review)
3. Protect fitness time (non-negotiable)

**Pattern to Break**: Planning = Shipping. I'm organising well but not executing fast enough.
