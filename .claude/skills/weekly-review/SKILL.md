- What surprised you?
- What confirmations did you get about what works?

### Step 2: Capture Learnings

**Reference memory files:**

- Review `memory/work_status.md` for project progress
- Note any updates needed to memory files

**Document insights worth preserving:**
- New approaches that worked
- Mistakes to avoid repeating

- Relationships to nurture

### Step 3: Plan the Coming Week

1. **Consistency over perfection** - A brief weekly review done consistently beats an elaborate one done sporadically
2. **Balance reflection and planning** - Equal time looking back and looking forward
3. **Capture actionable insights** - Focus on what can be applied, not just observed
4. **Connect to larger goals** - Link weekly priorities to bigger objectives
