# Strategic Multi-Perspective Analysis Workflow

**Purpose**: Sophisticated multi-perspective research for strategic analysis requiring nuanced understanding from multiple stakeholder viewpoints.

**When to use**:
- Complex strategic questions requiring multiple perspectives
- Long-term decision-making with far-reaching implications
- Market analysis requiring stakeholder viewpoint synthesis
- Policy or regulatory analysis across different interests
- Technology adoption requiring multi-dimensional assessment

**Time estimate**: 10-30 minutes
**Output**: Sophisticated multi-perspective synthesis with strategic insights

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Strategic Context Assessment
**Validate Strategic Analysis Need**:
- Multiple stakeholder perspectives critically important
- Long-term implications and strategic considerations present
- Complex trade-offs and nuanced understanding required
- Simple factual research insufficient for decision-making

**Stakeholder Mapping**:
- Identify primary stakeholders affected by topic
- Map different perspectives and potential conflicts
- Determine critical viewpoints for comprehensive understanding
- Plan perspective integration strategy

### 2. Multi-Perspective Investigation Design
**Perspective Matrix Planning**:

**Stakeholder Dimensions**:
- Primary users/customers
- Service providers/creators
- Industry experts/professionals
- Regulators/authorities
- Investors/business interests
- Critics/sceptics

**Analytical Dimensions**:
- Technical/functional analysis
- Economic/financial implications
- Social/cultural considerations
- Regulatory/legal factors
- Competitive/market dynamics
- Risk/benefit evaluation

**Temporal Perspectives**:
- Historical context and evolution
- Current state and immediate trends
- Short-term projections (6-12 months)
- Long-term implications (2-5 years)

### 3. Research Execution
**Execute Strategic Multi-Perspective Analysis**:

For each perspective in the matrix:
1. **Research from that viewpoint** specifically
2. **Identify key concerns and priorities** for that stakeholder
3. **Note potential conflicts** with other perspectives
4. **Document evidence and sources** with proper attribution
5. **Assess implications** from that perspective

**Perspective Matrix Template**:
```
Stakeholder Perspectives (5-10):
1. [Perspective 1]: Key concerns, priorities, evidence
2. [Perspective 2]: Key concerns, priorities, evidence
...

Analytical Dimensions:
- Technical: Findings and implications
- Economic: Findings and implications
- Regulatory: Findings and implications
...

Temporal Analysis:
- Historical context: [Summary]
- Current state: [Summary]
- Short-term outlook: [Summary]
- Long-term implications: [Summary]
```

### 4. Strategic Synthesis and Validation
**Multi-Perspective Integration**:
- Map findings across perspective matrix
- Identify areas of consensus and contradiction
- Recognise unique insights from specific viewpoints
- Assess strategic implications and trade-offs

**Strategic Quality Assurance**:
- All critical perspectives systematically addressed
- Complex viewpoints represented fairly and completely
- Strategic insights emerge from perspective integration
- Recommendations account for multiple stakeholder needs
- Implementation considerations addressed appropriately
