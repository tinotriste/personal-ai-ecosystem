# Comprehensive Investigation Workflow

**Purpose**: Multi-faceted research using multi-query decomposition for systematic coverage of complex topics.

**When to use**:
- Topics requiring multiple angles of investigation
- Comparative analysis across alternatives
- Systematic market or competitive research
- Complex problems needing structured breakdown
- Information synthesis from diverse sources

**Time estimate**: 5-15 minutes
**Output**: Comprehensive findings with multi-angle analysis

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Topic Deconstruction
**Analyse Research Requirements**:
- Identify core concepts and relationships
- Map different aspects requiring investigation
- Determine scope and depth requirements
- Plan systematic coverage strategy

**Complexity Validation**:
- Requires investigation from multiple angles
- Single-query search would miss important aspects
- Comparative or analytical elements present
- Synthesis across sources needed

### 2. Query Strategy Planning
**Design Multi-Query Approach**:
- Break topic into 3-7 complementary search angles
- Ensure queries are focused and non-redundant
- Plan validation and cross-reference strategy
- Identify potential information gaps

**Query Design Principles**:
- **Core Query**: Direct search for main topic
- **Perspective Queries**: Different angles or viewpoints
- **Specificity Queries**: Detailed aspects or sub-topics
- **Context Queries**: Background and related information
- **Comparison Queries**: Alternatives, competitors, benchmarks
- **Validation Queries**: Fact-checking and verification

### 3. Research Execution
**Execute Comprehensive Investigation**:

For each query angle:
1. **Conduct focused search** on specific aspect
2. **Evaluate source credibility** against quality standards
3. **Extract key findings** with proper attribution
4. **Note connections** to other query results
5. **Identify gaps** requiring additional investigation

**Investigation Structure**:
```
Query 1: [Core topic direct search]
Query 2: [Alternative perspective or approach]
Query 3: [Specific aspect or sub-topic]
Query 4: [Comparison or benchmark data]
Query 5: [Validation and verification]
Query 6: [Background and context]
Query 7: [Future trends or implications]
```

### 4. Results Validation and Synthesis
**Quality Assurance Process**:
- All planned investigation areas covered
- Multiple perspectives represented
- Sources cross-validated and credible
- Findings synthesised coherently
- Actionable recommendations provided

**Synthesis Approach**:
1. Map findings across all queries
2. Identify common themes and patterns
3. Note contradictions and resolve where possible
4. Draw evidence-based conclusions
5. Formulate recommendations

## Example Comprehensive Investigation Scenarios

## Quality Control Framework

**Pre-Investigation Checklist**:
- [ ] Topic complexity justifies comprehensive approach
- [ ] Investigation areas clearly defined and complementary
- [ ] Query strategy designed to avoid redundancy
- [ ] Quality requirements specified appropriately

**Post-Investigation Validation**:
- [ ] All planned investigation areas addressed
- [ ] Findings cross-validated across sources
- [ ] Synthesis logical and evidence-based
- [ ] Recommendations actionable and specific

## Escalation and Handoff

**Escalate to strategic-analysis.md if**:
- Multiple stakeholder perspectives emerge as critical
- Long-term strategic implications become apparent
- Complex decision-making context requires sophisticated analysis
- Political or organisational dynamics need consideration

**Return to quick-research.md if**:
- Investigation reveals topic is simpler than anticipated
- Specific factual questions emerge that need fast resolution

**Success Handoff to Action**:
- Clear recommendations provided for implementation
- Follow-up research needs identified if any
- User equipped for informed decision-making
