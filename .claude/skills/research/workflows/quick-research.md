# Quick Research Workflow

**Purpose**: Fast fact-finding and current information gathering for simple, factual questions.

**When to use**:
- Simple factual questions requiring current information
- Basic market data or recent developments
- Quick competitive intelligence
- Real-time trends and news verification
- Fast fact-checking and validation

**Time estimate**: 2-5 minutes
**Output**: Focused findings with key facts and sources

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Scope Assessment
**Validate Quick Research Appropriateness**:
- Question can be answered with current web information
- Requires minimal analysis or synthesis
- Single-angle investigation sufficient
- Time-sensitive or current information needed

**If NOT appropriate**: Route to comprehensive-investigation.md or strategic-analysis.md

### 2. Research Preparation
**Prepare Research Approach**:
- Formulate clear, specific research question
- Identify key search terms and concepts
- Determine required information depth
- Set quality standards for sources

### 3. Research Execution
**Execute Quick Research**:

1. **Use web search** to find current, authoritative information
2. **Focus on primary sources** (official websites, original publications)
3. **Verify currency** (check publication dates)
4. **Cross-reference** key facts with at least 2 sources

**Research Focus Areas**:
- Official documentation and announcements
- Recent news from reputable sources
- Industry publications and reports
- Verified expert commentary

### 4. Quality Validation
**Validate Results**:
- Provided specific facts with source attribution
- Information is current and relevant
- Sources meet credibility standards
- Key claims verified across multiple sources

### 5. Integration and Action
**Process and Apply Results**:
- Extract key actionable facts
- Note any follow-up research needed
- Provide clear answer to original question
- Suggest next steps if applicable

## Success Criteria

**Research Quality**:
- Current information (within 6 months for most topics)
- Credible source attribution
- Specific facts rather than general statements
- Clear relevance to original question
- Appropriate scope (not over-researched)

**Efficiency Metrics**:
- Time to answer: 2-5 minutes
- Source quality: 2+ credible sources minimum
- Information currency: Recent and relevant
- User satisfaction: Question adequately answered
- Follow-up need: Minimal additional research required

## Quality Control Checklist

**Before Finalising Results**:
- [ ] Information is current and accurately dated
- [ ] Sources are credible and properly attributed
- [ ] Facts are specific rather than vague
- [ ] Answer directly addresses the original question
- [ ] No obvious information gaps that would require additional research
- [ ] UK English used consistently
- [ ] Output formatted for easy consumption

## Escalation Criteria

**Escalate to comprehensive-investigation.md if**:
- Multiple aspects require investigation
- Topic complexity exceeds simple fact-finding
- Strategic implications need analysis
- Contradictory information found requiring deeper investigation

**Escalate to strategic-analysis.md if**:
- Question involves multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Long-term strategic implications identified
- Complex decision-making context discovered
- Multi-dimensional analysis required
